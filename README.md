# Atomic-Line-Info
Returns a tuple consisting of central wavelength, oscillator strength, gamma, and atomic weight for an ion of interest. The information is obtained from Peter van Hoof's website: https://www.pa.uky.edu/~peter/newpage/, which is hosted by the Department of Physics & Astronomy, University of Kentucky, and maintained by Peter Van Hoof, Royal Observatory of Belgium. The current development of the atomic line list is described in [van Hoof, P.A.M., 2018, Galaxies, 6, 63](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4434/6/2/63). Please cite this paper when you use any data from this list.
